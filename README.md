```
**HySwPub** is a **proof of concept (PoC)** for a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet using [Hyperswarm](https://github.com/holepunchto/hyperswarm). This project demonstrates how nodes (referred to as "clients" and "slaves") can discover each other and communicate through topic-based networking.

## üß™ Features

* Decentralized command-and-control using Hyperswarm
* Topic-based peer discovery (`client` and `slave` roles)
* Heartbeat system for client/slave status tracking
* Remote command execution on slave peers
* Real-time CLI feedback and connection status

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Niximkk/hyswpub.git
cd hyswpub
npm install
```

## ü™∂ Usage

### Start a Client Node

```bash
node client.js
```

This will:

* Join both client and slave topics
* Provide a command-line interface
* Send commands to all connected slave nodes

### Start a Slave Node

```bash
node slave.js
```

This will:

* Join the slave topic
* Respond to heartbeats
* Execute commands received from the client

## ‚ùó Important Notes

* Commands sent from the client are executed directly on the system of the slave. **Use with caution.**
* The client prints the number of connected clients and slaves in the terminal title.
* This project is a **PoC** and lacks robust security features (encryption, authentication, etc.).
